# Snowride
A faster RIDE-like IDE for Robot Framework test suites

Snowride is in early alpha. Many features aren't implemented yet. Many other features are unstable. Use at own risk.

It looks like this:

Planned advantages over other IDEs like RIDE or Intellij IDEA or text editors like Visual Studio Code:

* Very fast 
* Doesn't freeze up
* Automated repeated testing
* Search Anything-style autocompletion
* Inspections
* Fast test runner
* Skeuomorphically pretty ^^
* Single file executable
