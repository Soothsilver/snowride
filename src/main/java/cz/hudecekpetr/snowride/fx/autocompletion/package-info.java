/**
 * This is an edited copy of ControlsFX's autocompletion binding control. We need to make several changes to it,
 * to display icons, to allow different handlers for keyboard controls, to show popup documentation
 * and to have a better auto-fix when the completion box nears the edge of the monitor than JavaFX's default autofix.
